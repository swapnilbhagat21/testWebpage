<p>Admissions to the seats not reserved for the Jain religious minority, for first-year undergraduate engineering programs, are carried out via the Centralized Admissions Process (CAP) of the State Government's Directorate of Technical Education (DTE).[6] Entrance examinations are used: 85% of CAP seats are filled using the Composite Score followed by the Joint Entrance Examination score and HSC score (Maharashtra state students only). The remaining 15% of CAP seats are filled using the Composite Score after the Joint Entrance Examination score and HSC score (students for other Boards of Education).
 </p>

<p>Each engineering branch takes in 60 students. 
<br>
This intake is only for admissions to the first year of the 4-year B.E. degree program but includes direct admissions to the second year for Jain students who have completed 3-year engineering diplomas.
